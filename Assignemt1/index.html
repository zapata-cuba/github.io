                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Student number: S3853703<br>Email: S3853703@student.rmit.edu.au<br><br><br>I was Born in a city called Arequipa, Peru, in 1992 my family and I moved to New Zealand when I was still a teenager and completed my last year of high school in
                    that beautiful country.&nbsp;About 5 years later I moved to Australia, looking for new horizons, and here I am still!<br><br>Since my early childhood years, I developed a passion for music and by the time I was 15 years of age I found
                    myself performing in front of crowds already!&nbsp;Being native Peruvian I’ve always been drawn to native South American music.<br><br>While living in New Zealand I toured around the country as a musician, along with band I became
                    part of, I managed to get to know most places around this beautiful country and for that I’m grateful.&nbsp;Towards the late 90s I moved to Australia, still with music all around me, performing and touring around the country as well
                    as some of the pacific islands and parts of Europe.<br><br>These days music has become a hobby for me but when I look back to all those years of travelling and meeting so many different people of different backgrounds through playing
                    music, I feel blessed for all the life experiences and lessons learnt as it all has helped me greatly with me with my personal growth, it has taught me to be more tolerant with those around me, to be able to deal with difficult situations
                    and to work with people from all walks of life.<br>These days music has become a hobby for me but when I look back to all those years of travelling and meeting so many different people of different backgrounds through playing music,
