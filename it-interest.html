                    <p>These days it’s hard to imagine my life, or the life around most of us that matter, without IT.&nbsp;I have a huge interest in becoming an expert in IT comms and security, providing innovative and highly secure solutions for business
                        to communicate with their branches and clients all over the world, as well as allowing their employees to seamlessly work from the office, home or any remote location; the platforms providing these solutions today continue to evolve
                        to adapt to new trends, cyber threats and new technology available.<br><br>As technology advances more and more these days, so do cybercrimes and I believe it’s fair to say that most of us have become victim (or at least know someone
                        who has) of some form of cyber-attack, whether it’s been by phishing emails, identity theft, online banking fraud, ransomware, etc, the list goes on!&nbsp;Because of this, we cannot begin to think about implementing or start using
                        any form of technology without considering the security risks and implications, this calls for my interest in working with comms with a high security posture.&nbsp;In 2019 alone, cybercrimes accounted for $2 trillion dollars in
                        losses to business!<br></p>

                        <h4>How did I get into IT?</h4>
                        <p>My first interest in IT was through playing music, I still remember the excitement, of buying my first ever computer, a multimedia computer with a Sound Blaster 16 sound card in it! capable of sampling 16-bit digital audio.&nbsp;The
                            idea of using the computer for recording and manipulating audio files was just incredible for me at the time (1994)<br><br>Getting into digital audio and computers was mostly a hobby for me back then, I do remember setting
                            up a small, amateur recording studio of my own and managed to record some music on my own.&nbsp;However, my involved with computers grew more with time and this led me to do my do my studies in IT in 2004.<br><br></p>

                        <h4>My IT Experience so far</h4>
                        <p>After having&nbsp;completed my studies in 2004, my IT related work experiences mainly involved&nbsp;the following&nbsp;Customer Service and RMA returns officer (for a&nbsp;major Australian IT distributor)<br>Technical support to
                            external customers and&nbsp;internal users<br><br>A few years later&nbsp;(2010), I moved on to a global company in the mining sector, based in Brisbane&nbsp;(still my current job today).&nbsp; My role in&nbsp;this company has
                            been pretty much doing level 1, 2 and 3 IT support, as well as&nbsp;looking after a big part of our global IT infrastructure.<br><br>I have been given&nbsp;the opportunity to travel to most of our offices in the different countries
                            where&nbsp;we have operations (Indonesia, South Africa, United States, Brazil and Chile)&nbsp;where I led IT infrastructure upgrades, and office relocations.&nbsp; I was also relocated to our office in Chile,&nbsp;where I was
                            based for 7 years, having returned to Australia in July 2019.<br>Some of the tasks&nbsp;I’ve been doing in my current job, as well as the skills I’ve gained at my&nbsp;workplace are:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>ICT Support L1,
                            L2 &amp; L3<br>Network administration (AD, Server installs, upgrades&nbsp;and migration, Group Policies)<br>Desktop SOE design and deployment (Designed&nbsp;Windows 7 SOE and Windows 10 SOE for deployment to 200 + users across
                            7&nbsp;different countries)<br>Software packaging and deployment<br>Palo Alto Firewall Administration<br>PABX support (Avaya)<br>Skilled with VMware Virtual Infrastructure<br>Office 365 and Azure AD integration and support&nbsp;(Currently
                            on early stages)<br><br></p>

                        <h4>Why RMIT?</h4>
                        <p>I’ve been looking&nbsp;forward to going back to study for quite some time now, but the fact that I’ve&nbsp;been living overseas for 7 years for work reasons (during this time I got&nbsp;married and had two daughters) and also travelled
                            fairly often during my time<br>overseas, made it a bit difficult for me to engage in studying.<br><br>Now that I’m back&nbsp;in Australia, &nbsp;and have done some&nbsp;research, online as well as with friends and work peers,
                            about what entity I<br>should use to further my career in IT, just about all of my queries have taken&nbsp;me to look at RMIT as the place of choice.&nbsp;<br>This is something I already had I mind but doing the research gave
                            me&nbsp;the confidence that I was making the right decision, I’ve always known RMIT to<br>have a great reputation amongst the best Australian universities.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <h4>My Learning Expectations at RMIT</h4>
                        <p>I took the&nbsp;decision to study and work in IT several years ago.&nbsp; Moving from being a full-time musician into&nbsp;IT all those years ago mean a big career change for me, nevertheless I do not&nbsp;regret having made the
                            move, I still think it’s the best decision I could ever&nbsp;have made.<br><br>I feel that although&nbsp;that the concepts I learnt during my studies 15 years ago are still applicable&nbsp;to some extent, the technologies I’m
                            working with today didn’t exist back when&nbsp;I studied and what I am hoping to learn during my time at RMIT is to be able to&nbsp;work with today’s and tomorrow’s technologies and be capable of applying modern&nbsp;and secure
                            solutions to today’s challenges that we face when interacting with&nbsp;any form of technology in the corporate environment.<br><br></p>
